The Game (...for now)
=====================

A little FF6 inspired RPG collab between my sister and I. She's doing art, I'm doing code.

## Getting It to Run

1. Clone the git repo into its own folder.
2. Download and move the [Mongoose](https://www.cesanta.com/products/binary) web server binary into the repo's folder.
3. Launch Mongoose, open a browser, and point it to `http://localhost:8080/TheGame.html`.
4. Enjoy!
